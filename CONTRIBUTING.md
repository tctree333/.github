## Creating a good pull request
When creating a pull request, please title the PR with a short, clear idea of what the contribution is. In the description, please put details of what you intend this PR to add, remove, or change. For larger updates, please open a separate pull request for each new feature or modification. However, do not spam PRs, so use your best judgement.

Please note that many of my public repositories are archives of old projects and not intended for public contribution. If you want to know if I am accepting contributions on a repository, feel free to open an issue first.


## Creating a good issue
Issues can be opened for bugs, undesired behavior, feature requests, or other purposes. Please keep in mind that some of my public repositories (especially older ones) are not actively maintained/supported or intended for general use. 

If you are opening an issue to report a bug or undesired behavior, please give detailed information on what you did that lead to the issue, relavant information about your environment, relavant code snippets, any research you've done, or other things you've tried.

If you are opening an issue to request a feature or enhancement, please give detailed information about what the project is currently capable of, what specifically you want, and what problem will adding this feature solve.


Thanks!
